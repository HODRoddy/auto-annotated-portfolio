      As an artist manager, my goal is to help you grow your career without
      losing your authenticity. I offer a range of services designed to help you
      get noticed, build a loyal fan base, and take your music to new heights.


      **Services:**


      *   **Promotion & Press Coverage**:
          Getting the right press can make or break you. Even one write up can change everything. I work with media outlets that fit your sound, securing features and interviews that bring attention to your work. *Once budgets grow start thinking about publicists and PR outlets to build around the band*.

      *   **Venue Connections & Booking**:
          Playing live is where it all comes together. I connect you with the best venues, booking agents and promoters who align with your style, ensuring your shows are bustling and your fans are engaged. *Walk before you can run.*

      *   **Audience Growth & Engagement**:
          Building a dedicated fan base is key to long-term success. I can help you refine an authentic online presence, connect with fans who are as passionate about your music as you are, build and grow online stores.

      *   **Strategic Career Development/growth and funding strategies**:
          Whether it’s your next release, planning a tour, festival slots or securing funding, I work with you to create a strategy that’s built around your long-term goals and unique sound.
