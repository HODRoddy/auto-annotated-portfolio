Forming in 2022 in the musical mecca that is Manchester Dead Stilettos thrashed into the punk scene with their 'thunderous punk belter' **Don't wake me up** grabbing plaudits for '*airy vocals, fuzzed out guitars, killer riffs and ripping instrumentals*' and **Drive** bringing attention to their rising underground status, stage presence and DIY approach... *'raw but polished, commanding but infectious, heart pumping and addicting*'.

> *"Born from a speck of an idea, gritty friendship and sheer determination, Dead Stilettos are Manchester’s hottest new property. They have shoehorned their way into the DIY scene bringing a dose of punk mayhem straight to the main vein.  Since first appearing in 2022, they have developed a reputation for high octane live performances and their own distinct brand of Punk"*

They knew that while they were capturing their sound they would have to work hard and do things their own way and nothing epitomised that more than the legendary Castlefield Bowl gig on top of a barge (where the [Love is extinct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K3wXoGO4wY) video captures the day).

It was after these releases that they truly found their sound. Striking up a conversation in the smoking area they met their drummer Lucas and going onto record their first EP 'Dead Stilettos' they met a 'sound engineer' in Gaz who joined on sax and synth completing the set.

They went onto sell out YES Basement for their first live performance of the debut EP

> “It was an evening absolutely packed with energy, passion, intensity and just all-around great vibes flooding the room. From the lights to the audience interaction and the performances themselves, it was an incredible experience... a night for the ages”.

There's a big 2025 in store for Dead Stilettos with a tour of the North confirmed, a single and album release, several live studio records and some massive slots to be announced...
