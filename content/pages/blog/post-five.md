\*\*\*Garage rock/egg punk // For fans of: DEVO, The Stooges, OhSees, Viagra Boys, Beastie Boys // DIY Fuzz, synth and horns // Fun, odd, nostalgic, high energy.  \*\*\*

Forming in 2022 in the musical mecca that is Manchester Jack, Ollie and Brad shared an overpriced pint and bonded over their love for music. Deciding they wanted a slice of the pie Dead Stilettos thrashed into the local scene and their first 'thunderous punk belter' **Don't wake me up** was quick to grab plaudits for '*airy vocals, fuzzed out guitars, killer riffs and ripping instrumentals*' followed closely by **Drive** which captured their rising underground status, stage presence and DIY approach... *'raw but polished, commanding but infectious, heart pumping and addicting*'.

> *"Born from a speck of an idea, gritty friendship and sheer determination, Dead Stilettos are Manchester’s hottest new property. They have shoehorned their way into the DIY scene bringing a dose of punk mayhem straight to the main vein.  Since first appearing in 2022, they have developed a reputation for high octane live performances and their own distinct brand of Punk"* [Le Crowley ](https://www.backseatmafia.com/author/lesacr/)- Editor Backseat Mafia![](https://preview--hodrv2-5927b.stackbit.dev/images/bsm.png)

They knew that while they were capturing their sound they would have to work hard and do things their own way so spent long months of doing pubs, bars and anywhere that would tolerate them but nothing epitomised the spirit of this more than the legendary guerrilla Castlefield Bowl gig on top of a barge (where the [Love is extinct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K3wXoGO4wY) video captures the day). If Castlefield Bowl don't ask you to play there, why not organise your own...

It was after these releases, while working up to playing legendary Manchester venues like Night and Day cafe, that they truly clicked into place. Striking up a conversation in the smoking area they met their drummer Lucas and going onto record their first EP 'Dead Stilettos' they met a 'sound engineer' in Gaz who joined on sax and synth completing the set.

They ripped up what had come before so with one song on Spotify I didn't hold much hope that they'd done the right thing. They proved me wrong (and it'll be the last time that they do) selling out their EP Launch in YES Basement with people being turned away when the venue was at full capacity. 

> “It was an evening absolutely packed with energy, passion, intensity and just all-around great vibes flooding the room. From the lights to the audience interaction and the performances themselves, it was an incredible experience... a night for the ages”. [*Abby T*](https://www.instagram.com/abs.tapp75/)*- Music Is To Blame*![](/images/mitb-removebg-preview.png)

> "“Screw speaking in hushed tones, this needs shouting from the rooftops. Dead Stilettos are one of Manchester’s best new garage rock bands. They are plucked and pruned, shorn of fat, wirey and wicked to the very end. If this EP is anything to go by, we can expect a lot more to come from them. I for one will be waiting…”

The above is just one of the great write ups the band has achieved with no idea what they're doing, no formal team around them yet and no big bags of parents cash to burn. All organic, all built from building their status in Manchester the hard way

Despite an already fast start there's an even bigger 2025 in store for Dead Stilettos with a tour of the North confirmed, a single release in April, an album release in October, several live studio records and some massive festival slots to be announced...

Now we build a team.
