**What an evening** - 7th Feb was the launch of Dead Stilettos debut EP titled 'Dead Stilettos'

It's the culmination of a lot of hard work in 2024 from the band and Sour Grapes setting the foundations for this year to be packed full of releases, growth and spreading their wings across the UK.

That being said it was poetic to see the evening being received so well. A Friday night, a quality venue absolutely packed out and two incredible openers to get the evening kicked off and then Dead Stilettos showcasing what they've spent the past few years refining in both their sound, their stage presence the visuals and the audience interaction. High energy, fast tempo no time to stop and think. Ideal.

There was an incredible write up afterwards by[ Abby at Music Is To Blame](https://www.musicistoblame.co.uk/2025/02/dead-stilettos-and-ep-launch-party.html) summing up what it was like to be in the crowd perfectly with "a night for the ages".

Never an easy  feat selling out especially given the competitiveness of the music scene in Manchester but months of hard work, planning and a strong connection with the fans all combined for a perfect evening.
